# Contributing to Sharetribe

First of all, thank you so much! We greatly appreciate all contributions!

However, before you do, here are some basic rules:

## Small bug fixes

1. Fix the issue
2. Rebase (or merge) your branch to include the latest changes from `master`
3. Open a Rull Request from your fork to `master`
4. Make sure all the tests pass

## New features

Before you do any coding, please talk with us. Join the [Sharetribe Development Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/invitations/4f606b0784e5758bfdb25c30515df47cff28f7d5-main) chat and tell us what you are about to do. This helps us to make sure the awesome feature you are about to code is inline with Sharetribe's common goals and the road map. The early on discussion ensures that you get your feature eventually merged to Sharetribe.

After you've discussed with the core team:

1. Start coding
2. [Open a Pull Request from your fork to master as early as possible. Pull Requests are great way to start conversation of a feature.](https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github) If the Pull Request is work in progress and not yet ready to be reviewed, add a \[WIP\] prefix to the title.
3. Rebase (or merge) your branch to include the latest changes from `master`
4. Make sure all the tests pass
5. Remove the \[WIP\] prefix and ping the core team to review the Pull Request.
