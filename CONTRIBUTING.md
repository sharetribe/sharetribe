# Contributing to Sharetribe

First of all, thank you so much! We greatly appreciate all contributions!

However, before you do, here are some basic guidelines:

## Small bug fixes

1. Fix the issue in a branch of your own fork of Sharetribe
2. Rebase (or merge) your branch to include the latest changes from `master`
3. Open a Pull Request from your fork to `master`
4. Make sure all the tests pass

## New features

Before you do any coding, please talk with us. Join the [Sharetribe Development Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/invitations/4f606b0784e5758bfdb25c30515df47cff28f7d5-main) chat and tell us what you are about to do. This helps us to make sure the awesome feature you are about to code is inline with Sharetribe's common goals and the road map. The early on discussion ensures that you get your feature eventually merged to Sharetribe. Also, we might have been planning something similar and could be able to assist you with helpful information.

After you've discussed with the core team:

1. Start coding in a branch of your own fork of Sharetribe
2. [Open a Pull Request from your fork to master as early as possible. Pull Requests are great way to start conversation of a feature.](https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github) If the Pull Request is work in progress and not yet ready to be reviewed, add a \[WIP\] prefix to the title.
3. Please make tests for your new feature. That's the best way to guarantee that other developers won't accidentally break your feature.
4. When you are ready rebase (or merge) your branch to include the latest changes from `master`
5. Make sure all the tests pass
6. Remove the \[WIP\] prefix and ping the core team to review the Pull Request.
