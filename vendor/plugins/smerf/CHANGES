== Version 0.1.1
Move repository to GitHub

Bug Fixes.

* It appears that making changes directly to the view_paths array has been deprecated in 
  Rails 2.1 onward and #append_view_path or #prepend_view_path should be used instead. 
  Template for smerf_init.rb changed to use append_view_path.
* Dependencies is deprecated from Rails 2.2 onward and ActiveSupport::Dependencies should 
  be used instead. Template for smerf_init.rb changed to use ActiveSupport::Dependencies.

Enhancements.

* Added the ability for the generator to skip migrations by adding the --skip-migration
  option. To re-run the generator without creating the migration you can do something 
  like this:
     ./script/generate smerf user --skip-migration  

== Version 0.1.0
Bug Fixes.

* Modify generator to convert model name to lowercase
* Fix minor bug in smerf_forms_user template, additional 's' was being added to a variable name 
* Include smerf_responses.rb in generated files as content on file depends on specified user model
* Re-write all smerf form processing classes. This was done to prevent the use of class variables
  which caused all sorts of problems. Also the classes are much simpler and cleaner which will 
  make it easier to understand.
* Remove the use of a class variable to store the smerf_user_id as this may have caused
  results for one user to be stored against the user that last logged into the system. Instead
  of using SmerfForm.smerf_user_id to set the id of the user record you now need to do:
    self.smerf_user_id = ...
  You will also need to include the Smerf module in the controller where SMERF is to be used or
  in the application.rb if you want to use it for all controllers, i.e.
    include Smerf

== Version 0.0.4
Bug Fix.
* There was a problem with how responses where being handled for the new 
  selectionbox question type. It was incorrectly accessing the response 
  as an array when it was a string. Thanks to Alan Masterson for finding 
  and reporting the bug.

== Version 0.0.3
Minor Enhancements.
* Add new selectionbox question type.
* Add selectionbox_multiselect question option.
* Delete all non-template files from the generator templates directory.
* Move all non-template files to the plugin app directories.
* Modify the generator to use the new structure.
* Update RDoc with new question type details.

== Version 0.0.2
Minor fix.
* Changed rdoc generation to not generate the generator directory preventing the conflict.
