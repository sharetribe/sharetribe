          If you want to allow your users to accept online payments, you need to choose the currency for your marketplace and then connect at least one of the two payment providers supported by Sharetribe: Stripe and PayPal. You can also choose to use both, which means your users will be able to accept payments with either payment method.
          You can create a new account with either service if you don't have one already. Once you have connected an account, you can choose a possible fee you're charging from each transaction.
          What's the difference between Stripe and PayPal? Stripe allows you to delay payout to the seller up to 3 months and offers one payment method (credit/debit card). Stripe also allows your sellers to receive money directly to their bank account simply by providing their bank details. PayPal provides two payment methods (credit card and PayPal account) and offers a protection program for buyers and sellers. It requires your sellers to create a PayPal Business Account to accept payments.
          If you use Stripe, its fees will be deducted from your transaction fee, so remember to set a high enough minimum fee. If you use PayPal, its fees will be charged from the seller separately, in addition to your transaction fee. Stripe and PayPal have a bit different fee structure. In most cases Stripe's fees are a bit lower.
