  # Your CDN distribution host name
  #
  # From Rails documations: Browsers typically open at most two simultaneous connections to a single host,
  # which means your assets often have to wait for other assets to finish downloading. You can alleviate
  # this by using a %d wildcard in the asset_host. For example, “assets%d.example.com”. If that wildcard
  # is present Rails distributes asset requests among the corresponding four hosts
  # “assets0.example.com”, …, “assets3.example.com”. With this trick browsers will open eight simultaneous
  # connections rather than two.
  #

  #
  # When "user_asset_host" is left blank and S3 is NOT in use, then assets are linked via Sharetribe's installation
  # domain or using the "asset_host" (if configured). If S3 is enabled and "user_asset_host" is left blank,
